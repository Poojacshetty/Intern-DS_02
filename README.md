### Project Title: Fraud Transactions Detection

#### Project Description
This project aims to identify fraudulent transactions using a dataset containing various transaction attributes. By applying machine learning techniques, we develop a model to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.

#### Objectives
- **Data Collection**: Utilize a labeled dataset of transactions that includes features such as transaction amount, date, merchant, and user information.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values and normalizing features.
- **Model Development**: Implement and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to detect fraud.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

#### Expected Outcomes
- A trained model capable of detecting fraudulent transactions.
- A report detailing model performance and insights from the analysis.
- Visualizations to illustrate key patterns in the data.
